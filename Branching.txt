## Create a branch:

git checkout -b branch_name


## Work with branches:
after working create a PR 

## When branch is ahead of master :
After mergin now remotly both are updated but locally our master branch is behind.

git checkout master
git pull (if upstream is already setup)



# we don't use the branches that we have already merged so therefore we will delete this branch.

git branch -d branch_name













Conflict arise when working and merging branches simulatenously.


1. Created another branch (working)
git checkout -b working

2. for modified files: i.e add files & message
git commit -am "message"
